This is a demo/proof-of-concept for a game based on quick-time events I developed throughout the summer of 2024.

It was originally planned to be much bigger, but I decided to stop working on it due to my desire to work on different projects and 
personal health concerns. It contains a working 2-player mode, a very basic computer player, customizable skins, customizable game rules, and a primitive online
multiplayer system that can be manipulated by altering the code directly.
